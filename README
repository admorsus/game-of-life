A newer version of this program is in the master branch. It has a lot of
 inprovenments, better use of the C language, better performance, more
 options and a MUCH clear code.

However, I'd like to keep this old version here, because I think it's a
 good example of how to make something cool knowing only very basic C,
 without havig a idea about structs, not knowing much about pointers...

I hope you don't dislike it too much! :-)
